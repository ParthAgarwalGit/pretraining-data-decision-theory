# Decisions Log

Append-only. Every entry: date, decision, rationale, who decided. Never
edit or delete a past entry — if a decision is reversed, add a new entry
that supersedes it and says so.

## 2026-09-01 — Repository name, visibility, licence

**Context:** Task P0-02 requires proposing repo name, visibility, licence,
and Hugging Face namespace to the PI before creating anything (part of
GATE-0).

**Decision:**
- GitHub repo name: `pretraining-data-decision-theory`
- Visibility: private, to be flipped to public at GATE-S (submission approval)
- Licence: Apache-2.0
- Hugging Face namespace: personal (`Parth4105`), not the `Algoverse-AYJP` org

**Rationale:** Private-until-submission avoids scoop risk given the novelty
caveats already flagged in `plan/01-phase0-setup.md` (P0-07) — the source
document's own novelty check was explicitly "not provably exhaustive."
Apache-2.0 is standard for ML research code and includes a patent grant.
Personal HF namespace was chosen because this project's HF affiliation with
Algoverse-AYJP was not confirmed at time of asking.

**Decided by:** Parth (PI), via `AskUserQuestion` at the start of P0-02 execution.

## 2026-09-01 — Branch protection unavailable; enforced by convention instead

**Context:** Task P0-02 step 8 requires branch protection on `main`
(required review, no force-push) or, if unavailable on the current GitHub
plan, a documented fallback.

**Decision:** `gh api -X PUT .../branches/main/protection` returned
`403 — "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this
feature."` GitHub's free plan does not support branch protection rules on
private repositories. Protection is therefore **enforced by convention**:
no session pushes directly to `main` after the bootstrap commit
(`c394495`, LICENSE + README). Every subsequent change lands via a
`phase<N>/<slug>` branch and a pull request that the PI reviews and merges.
This is a discipline the agent protocol (`plan/00-agent-protocol.md`) already
mandates for other reasons (never self-merge), so the missing platform
enforcement is a reduced-safety-net situation, not a missing-process one.

**Rationale:** Upgrading to GitHub Pro or making the repo public solely to
unlock this feature is not worth doing before GATE-S, given the
private-until-submission decision above.

**Decided by:** Agent, following the explicit fallback instruction in
`plan/01-phase0-setup.md` task P0-02, step 8.
